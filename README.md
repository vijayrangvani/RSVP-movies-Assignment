## Overview
This project showcases a comprehensive **RSVP Movies SQL Analysis** focusing on key performance indicators such as box office collections, movie ratings, audience preferences, and genre trends. Using **SQL** for querying the dataset, we extract insights to aid in making data-driven decisions about future movie projects.

## Key Features
- **Box Office Analysis**: Analyze total revenue and identify top-grossing movies.
- **Audience Preferences**: Evaluate which movies received the highest ratings.
- **Genre Trends**: Analyze the most popular genres and seasonal trends.
- **SQL Queries**: Efficient querying for data cleaning, aggregation, and analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **MSSQL**: SQL Server for querying the IMDb movies dataset.
- **Data Visualization**: Recommendations are based on SQL analysis, derived from the raw dataset.

## What I Learned
- Advanced **SQL querying** techniques for large datasets.
- **Data cleaning** and preprocessing to ensure accurate analysis.
- Optimizing **SQL queries** for performance and efficiency.
- Generating actionable insights for business strategy.

## File Structure
- `SQL-Movies-Analysis.sql`: SQL queries to analyze the RSVP Movies dataset.
- `Data/IMDb_movies.csv`: Raw dataset used for the analysis.
- `Documentation/EXECUTIVE SUMMARY.pdf`: Contains high-level insights and recommendations based on the SQL analysis.

## How to Run This Project
1. **MSSQL**: Use any SQL Server environment (e.g., SQL Server Management Studio) to execute the queries.
2. **Load Data**: Import the dataset (`Data/IMDb_movies.csv`) into your SQL environment.
3. **Run Queries**: Execute the queries from `SQL-Movies-Analysis.sql` to perform the analysis.

## Insights Delivered
